# odin_recipes
This is a recipe site with quick, easy and nutritious recipes.
The page has been designed and laid layout to allow for easy navigation.
The recipes are very easy to follow.
I built the site using the html elements like; heading tag, image tag, paragraph tag, unordered list, list, emphasize tag, strong tag, link tag etc.
I used relative file path to link the different pages on the site.
I used absolute file path to link images to external sources.
